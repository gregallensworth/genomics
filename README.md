# Genomics Work and NOtes

Last month I was given a copy of a friend's whole genome sequence (WGS) from Nebula Genomics, and tasked with looking for short tandem repeats (STRs) indicative/causative of diseases such as SBMA and Huntington's.

There is a lot of documentation, but much of it incomplete, some outdated, and rarely describing how to set up the data from the sequencing company. It took a month of long nights and dead ends, but now the process takes about a half-hour to set up, 11 hours of overnight crunching, and a half-hour to run and report.

And here it is for you, for what it's worth.
